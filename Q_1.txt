What is React JS?
React JS is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. The main concept behind React is the component-based architecture, where the user interface is broken down into reusable components.
